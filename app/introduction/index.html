                The Women in Public Service in Pakistan Oral History Archive is an effort to document the contributions of women in public life in Pakistan. The project collects and preserves professional life histories of women who served as officers in the occupation groups of the Pakistan Civil Service and as leaders in other institutions, autonomous organizations or corporations which provide government services. The project leaders, affiliated faculty and students who contribute to their project give their time and efforts to grow this archive of testimonials for the use of present and future researchers while adhering to Oral History best practices. Recordings and the transcriptions of the interviews will be made available in the LUMS library premises to LUMS faculty students and researchers and visiting scholars.
